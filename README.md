#Rooster Teeth Desktop App - Unofficial

Hello there, this is an unofficial desktop app, I'm just a huge fan of Rooster Teeth and well since I'm a in the web industry working as a front end developer and lately I've been building projects in React to learn about it, I thought of building an desktop app using Electron.. so here it is....



Before you ask I do not work for Rooster Teeth and this isn't a attempt to get Rooster Teeth attention to see if I could work for them.

And if any employee(s) of Rooster Teeth see this repo and especially if you are in the engineering department at Rooster Teeth you are more than welcome to clone this project and improve it or do what ever.

####Once again this is unofficial desktop app of Rooster Teeth

*Please note: do not `npm run build` in your terminal as the build will fail no matter what, as it's due to code signing *
